This demo project is the part of keynote speaking in [BKK.JS Meetup #16](https://www.eventpop.me/e/13479) @Microsoft Thailand session called *"Say goodbye to passwords...permanently"*

Keynote presentation slide can be found [here in my storage](https://storage.rayriffy.com/files/bkkjs16-says-goodbye-to-password.pdf)

There're hidden [extended version](https://storage.rayriffy.com/files/bkkjs16-says-goodbye-to-password-extended.pdf) of this slide as well. It's unsync with latest content I reccomended to read the regular version first before going deep into code.
